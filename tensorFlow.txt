1. first create a new environment:
conda create -n dataScience python=3 pandas scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib

2. activate the environment:
source activate dataScience

3. don't install tensorFLow using pip, because the version installed by tensorFLow won't optimize the performance of my CPU.
If used pip for install, you should get the warning: Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA

4. build tensorFlow from the source, first instll bazel
brew install bazel

5. follow steps specified at:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#PrepareMac 
./configure # then following the default config process
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.6.0rc1-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_7_x86_64.whl # substitute the last file with whatever inside the path

done

don't forget reinstall spyder under new environment, in order to use conda:
